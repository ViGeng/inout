# In-out

A simple iOS and macOS app for tracking items with titles, amounts, and timestamps.

*   View/delete items in a list showing the title and timestamp
*   View the details of each item showing the title, amount, and timestamp
*   Search transactions by title, category, amount, currency, and notes.
*   Improved detail view layout for transactions.
*   Dashboard with monthly netto summaries (income, expenses, and balance).
*   Detailed view of category expenses for each month.
*   Automatic currency conversion to local currency for all summaries (using hardcoded, user-modifiable rates).

## Roadmap

*   **iCloud Sync:** Integrate iCloud synchronization for seamless data access across devices. (Unfortunately, I cannot afford the Apple Developer Program at the moment, so this feature is not implemented yet.)
*   **Recurring Transactions:** Add support for recurring transactions to automate regular entries, such as monthly bills or subscriptions.
*   **Export/Import:** Implement features to export and import transaction data.
*   **Improve App Icon:** Enhance the app icon for better visual appeal.
*   **AI Integration:** Import transactions from photos/files(pdf for example) using AI to recognize text and amounts.
