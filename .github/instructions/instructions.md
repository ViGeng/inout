# Develop Style

- Minimum working principle: Aim to implement the simplest solution that works for the given problem. Avoid over-engineering and focus on delivering value quickly.
- Iterative development: based on existing implementations, make small, incremental changes to improve the system to meet evolving requirements/features.
- Prefer concise, clean code: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful names for variables and functions, and avoid unnecessary complexity. Avoid lengthy code, comments, and documentation. Try to keep the project structure simple and intuitive.
